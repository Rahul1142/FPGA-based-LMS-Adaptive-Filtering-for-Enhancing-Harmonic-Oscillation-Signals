# FPGA-based-LMS-Adaptive-Filtering-for-Enhancing-Harmonic-Oscillation-Signals
The objective of this project was to implement an FPGA-based LMS adaptive filter  to
filter out noise from a sinusoidal signal.

The project aimed to demonstrate the  effectiveness of the LMS algorithm in filtering 
out noise from a signal. 

Implementation: Develop and deploy an adaptive filtering system using the LMS algorithm 
within an FPGA architecture. 

Demonstration: Showcase the adaptability and real-time processing capabilities of 
the LMS algorithm in reducing noise interference from a sinusoidal signal.

Validation: Verify the performance of the adaptive filter by fine-tuning 
parameters and refining filter coefficients to achieve an output closely resembling
a pure sinusoidal wave, considering the limitations and intricacies of FPGA 
implementations. 

Analysis: Assess the effectiveness of the adaptive filter in enhancing signal fidelity 
by comparing the filtered output with the original pristine signal and evaluating the 
degree of noise reduction achieved.
The project aims to not only implement the theoretical concepts but also validate 
and demonstrate their practical effectiveness, emphasizing the potential of FPGA-based
adaptive filters in real-world signal processing applications.
