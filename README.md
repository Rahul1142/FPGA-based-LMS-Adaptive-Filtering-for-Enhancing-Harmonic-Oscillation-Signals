# FPGA-based-LMS-Adaptive-Filtering-for-Enhancing-Harmonic-Oscillation-Signals
The objective of this project was to implement an FPGA-based LMS adaptive filter  to filter out noise from a sinusoidal signal. The project aimed to demonstrate the  effectiveness of the LMS algorithm in filtering out noise from a signal.
